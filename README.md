## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

My name is Shafiq Akiya, IT graduate from Petronas University
of Technology. I have experience of having a 6-monthh internship
in Japan as an intern for Mitsubishi Fuso.

During my internship I learned to develop an analysis portal using node.js, MS Azure (for CI) and utilizing HTML and CSS to design it. I was having so much fun doing that task and got a recognition from my colleagues and manager.

After graduation, I worked as a Business Analyst at Novartis Malaysia for 1 year. There I learned about SAP HCM but deep in my heart, I would like to pursue as a Frontend Dev.

I bought a Web Development Bootcamp from Angela Yu in Udemy and I inspired by her story of how she started as a doctor and ended up as a developer.

This is a challenge that I've joined after taking part of
the bootcamp. There are few more courses for me to complete but I would like to challenge myself in CSS first before that.

I am inspired to become a good Frontend Developer and for me this is a right step for me to pursue such career.
